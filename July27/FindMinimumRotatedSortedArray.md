# Find the Minimum in a Rotated, Sorted Array

A sorted array of integers, containing no duplicates, is "rotated" at an unknown pivot point (like cutting a deck of cards)--eg, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` becomes `[5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. Find the minimum element in the array.

Examples:
```
Input: [9, 10, 11, 3, 4]
Output: 3
```

```
Input: [5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 0
```

```
Input: [12, 13, 14, 15, 9, 10, 11]
Output: 9
```
