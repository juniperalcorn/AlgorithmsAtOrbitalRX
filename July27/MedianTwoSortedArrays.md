# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Given two sorted arrays--varying lengths, containing all integers--find the median value. The output should be a float.

Examples:

```
Input:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

Output:
2.0
```

```
Input:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2+3)/2

Output:
2.5
```

The input arrays will always have length >= 1, and values in the arrays will always be whole numbers. 

Median definition: "... a median is a value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population or a probability distribution. For a data set, it may be thought of as 'the middle' value." [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)
