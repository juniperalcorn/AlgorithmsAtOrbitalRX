# List of Lists

You have a two-dimensional list in the following format:

```
data = [[2, 5], [3, 4], [8, 7]]
```

Each sub-list contains two items, and each item in the sub-lists is an integer.

Write a function `process_data()` that processes each sub-list like so:

`[2, 5]` --> `2 - 5` --> `-3`
`[3, 4]` --> `3 - 4` --> `-1`
`[8, 7]` --> `8 - 7` --> `1`
and then returns the product of all the processed sub-lists: `-3 * -1 * 1` --> `3`.

For input, you can trust that neither the main list nor the sublists will be empty.
