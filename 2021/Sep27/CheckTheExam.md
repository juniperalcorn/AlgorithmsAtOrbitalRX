# Check the Exam

The first input array is the key to the correct answers to an exam, like ["a", "a", "b", "d"]. The second one contains a student's submitted answers.

The two arrays are not empty and are the same length. Return the score for this array of answers, giving +4 for each correct answer, -1 for each incorrect answer, and +0 for each blank answer, represented as an empty string (in C the space character is used).

If the score < 0, return 0.

Examples:
```
checkExam(["a", "a", "b", "b"], ["a", "c", "b", "d"]) → 6
checkExam(["a", "a", "c", "b"], ["a", "a", "b",  ""]) → 7
checkExam(["a", "a", "b", "c"], ["a", "a", "b", "c"]) → 16
checkExam(["b", "c", "b", "a"], ["",  "a", "a", "c"]) → 0
```
