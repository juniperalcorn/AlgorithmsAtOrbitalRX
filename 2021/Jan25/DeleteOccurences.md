# Delete Occurrences of an Element Occurring More Than N Times

Given a list of integers containing duplicates, and a maximum number of duplicates (`N`), return a list where no element occurs more than `N` times. You do not need to sort the list.

```
Input: N = 2, [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3,1,2,3]
```
