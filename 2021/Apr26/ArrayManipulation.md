# Array Manipulation

Given an array of positive integers, replace every element with the least greater element to its right. If there is no greater element to its right, replace it with -1. Return a new array, do not simply modify the original array.

Examples:
```
input: [8, 58, 71, 18, 31, 32, 63, 92, 43, 3, 91, 93, 25, 80, 28]
output: [18, 63, 80, 25, 32, 43, 80, 93, 80, 25, 93, -1, 28, -1, -1]
```
