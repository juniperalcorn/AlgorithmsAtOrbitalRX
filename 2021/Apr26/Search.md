# Search

Given a sorted list of integers (0-n, inclusive), and a single integer value (0 \le input \le n), find the index of the single integer value in the sorted list. If the value is not in the list, return `-1`, otherwise return the index

Examples: 
```
input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 10
output: 9

input: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 10
output: 10

input: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 22
output: -1
```

Challenge: perform the search with native language methods, and with loops, and with binary search. See this month's readme for more information on binary search.
