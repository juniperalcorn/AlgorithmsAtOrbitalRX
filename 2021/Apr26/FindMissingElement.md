# Find the Missing Element

Our sequence given was supposed to contain all of the integers from 0 to 9 (in no particular order), but one of them seems to be missing.

Write a function that accepts a sequence of unique integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and returns the missing element.

Examples: 
```
input: [0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 7, 6, 4] 
output: 8

input: [9, 2, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8, 6, 1]
output: 3
```
