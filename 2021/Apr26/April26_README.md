# April 26 Meetup

The theme for this month's meetup is trees, and binary search trees! Our problems will cover both array manipulation, and tree creation/traversal. You might want to warm up with the earlier problems, then dive into binary search trees, or start by reviewing binary search trees and then implementing them to solve all of the problems. It's your time!

Binary search tree information:
- [Video: Cracking the Coding Interview Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3YID7liBug&ab_channel=HackerRank)
