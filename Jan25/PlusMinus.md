# Plus Minus

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

Example: 
```
input = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]
output: 
0.400000
0.400000
0.200000
```

There are  elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios are `2/5`, `2/5`, and `1/5`, which are solved as decimals to six places.
