# Sort By Name

Sort a list of integers [1, 2, 3] alphabetically by name ("one", "two", "three"), and return the sorted list of integers [1, 3, 2]

Input:
- Range from 0 - 999
- Possible duplicates
- Array may be empty

Example:
```
Input: 1, 2, 3, 4
Equivalent names: "one", "two", "three", "four"
Sorted by name: "four", "one", "three", "two"
Output: 4, 1, 3, 2
```

Don't fret about formatting rules. If rules are consistently applied it has no effect anyway:
 - e.g. one hundred one, one hundred two is same order as one hundred and one, one hundred and two
 - e.g. ninety eight, ninety nine is same order as ninety-eight, ninety-nine
