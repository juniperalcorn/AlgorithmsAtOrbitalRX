# Squares of a Sorted Array

Given a sorted, ascending array of integers, return an array of the squares of each number (also sorted in ascending order).

Examples:
```
Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]

Input: [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

The arrays will always have length of at least 1, and values in the array will always be whole numbers.
