# Team Weights

Several people need to be sorted into two teams, so you put them in line and have them count off `one, two, one, two`. All the `ones` are a team and all the `twos` are a team. Next, you need to sum the total weight of each team.

Given a list of weights (integers), return the sum of the weight of each team.

Examples:
```
Input: [13, 27, 49]
Output: 62, 27

Input: [50, 60, 70, 80]
Output: 120, 140

Input: [80]
Output: 80, 0
```
