# Dominant Elements of an Array

An element in an array is `dominant` if it is greater than all the elements to its right (including if it's the last element in the list). For any given array, return a list of all the dominant elements.

Examples:
```
Input: [1,21,4,7,5]
Output: [21, 7, 5]

Input: [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5]
```
