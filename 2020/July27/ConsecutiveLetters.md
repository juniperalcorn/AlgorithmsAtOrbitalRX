# Consecutive Letters

Check if a string contains consecutive letters as they appear in the alphabet, and occur only once. Letters do not need to be in order (see example). Return `true` if anywhere in the string it contains only consecutive letters, return `false` if there are none.

Examples:
```
input: "abc"   => True 
input: "abd"   => False, because `c` is missing
input: "dabc"  => True, because `abcd` are consecutive
input: "abbc"  => False, because `b` occurs twice
input: "v"     => True
```
