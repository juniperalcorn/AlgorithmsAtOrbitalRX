# Number Sort

This is a basic sorting problem, but the challenge is to look up and practice a particular approach to sorting that you might not be familiar with. If you look up information on the different problem solving approaches, try to just read through the explanations (don't read the example problems) and work through the implementation in your group.

Given an unordered list of integers, sort them in ascending value and return the ordered list.

Example:
```
Input: [9, 2, 17, 0, 5, 13, 1]
Output: [0, 1, 2, 5, 9, 13, 17]
```
