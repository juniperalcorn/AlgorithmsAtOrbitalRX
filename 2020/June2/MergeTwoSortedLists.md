# Merge Two Sorted Lists

Given two sorted lists of integers, merge the two lists into a single, ordered list of integers and return the new list.

Example:
```
Input: [1, 7, 12, 14], [1, 2, 9, 12]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 7, 9, 12, 12]
```
*Challenge yourself:* Merge two sorted *linked lists.*
Example:
```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```
