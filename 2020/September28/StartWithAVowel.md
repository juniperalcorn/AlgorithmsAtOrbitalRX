# Start With a Vowel

Given a string (`sentence`) including any characters with at least one vowel, manipulate and return the string such that each word/substring starts with a vowel. The letters are in the same order, just the spaces are rearranged such that every vowel is the start of a new word. The first word of the sentence may start without a vowel (no need to add new characters). The returned value should be all lowercare, with no punctuation/special characters.

Examples:
```
 input: 'It is beautiful weather today!' 
 output: 'it isb e a ut if ulw e ath ert od ay'

 input: 'Coding is great' 
 output: 'c od ing isgr e at'

 input: 'my number is 0208-533-2325' 
 output: 'myn umb er is02085332325'
```
