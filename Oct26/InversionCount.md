# Inversion Count

Given an unsorted array of integers, count the number of inversions in the array. Return the count as an integer.

An inversion is when (i < j) and (X[i] > Y[j]). Count all such pairs in the array.

Examples:
```
Input: [1, 9, 6, 4, 5]
Output: 5
```
<i>The inversions for the first example are:
(9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5)
</i>
```
Input: [4, 3, 5, 2, 9]
Output: 4

```
