# Sort By Frequency & Index

Given an array, sort its elements by their frequency and index. Return the sorted array.
- The element with the most frequencies should come first.
- If two elements have the same frequencies, then the one that appears at a lower index should come first.

Examples: 
```
Input: [9, 9, 0, 0, 8, 0, 9, 8, 7]
Output: [9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 7]

Input: [3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 6, 8, 7, 8]
Output: [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 6, 7]
```

Extension: How would you solve this with string values?
