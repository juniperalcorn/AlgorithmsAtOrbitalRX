# Positive Foot Forward

Given an unsorted array with both negative and positive integers, move all the positive numbers to the front of the array! Negatives to the back of the line! The numbers do not need to be additionally sorted in ascending/descending value, or by index. 

Sort the numbers in linear time and constant space.

Examples: 
```
Input: [9, 12, -3, 7, -17, -1, -35, 22, -4]
Output: [22, 9, 12, 7, -3, -17, -1, -4, -35]

Input: [-4, 3, -2, 1, -5, 7]
Output: [7, 1, 3, -4, -2, -5]

```
