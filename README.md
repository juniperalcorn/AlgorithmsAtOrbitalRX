# AlgorithmsAtOrbitalRX

Algorithms at OrbitalRX is a once-monthly Women Who Code Meetup in Raleigh, NC. Each month, we provide a set of algorithm questions for small groups to collaboratively whiteboard in their preferred coding language. The questions will be on roughly the same topic and will increase in difficulty.

Beginners Welcome! If you want to attend but aren’t sure where to start, we will have a beginners break-out session to introduce algorithms and programmatic problem solving. We encourage you to work with a group on solving problems, it’s a great opportunity to learn through hands-on practice with your peers.

This repo is homebase, with the problems for each meetup in dated directories. Below, find more resources on algorithms, problem solving, or the inspiration for this meetup!
